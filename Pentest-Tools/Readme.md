1. Pwncat - There are 2 repos of this same tool and its been developed by two different teams and have different functionality and both are worth a check

a - https://github.com/calebstewart/pwncat.git      (This one is by John Hammond and team)
b - https://github.com/cytopia/pwncat.git

2. Feroxbuster - Netcat is to Pwncat as Gobuster is to Feroxbuster. Feroxbuster is the upgrade to your directory fuzzing/busting tool. Works faster, 
3. looks cooler, and has a bunch of features to make scans more nuanced.
